<b>WHO WE ARE/About us</b>:The infrastructure work and what ever is there on drawing sheets, we make it real by constructing it for an amount agreed prior with their 
clients. First and foremost job our company does is to look for construction works in the market.Construction companies executes the building / infrastructure work and what ever is there on drawing sheets, they make it real by constructing it for an amount agreed prior with their clients.

First and foremost job a construction company does is to look for construction works in the market.

Let's take for example, a government body floats a tender to construct a 10 Storey building and 2 Km of road works along with drainage and sewers. Construction 
companies would receive the tender bid documents including the already prepared design drawings and Bill of Quantities.

Normally people from tender division in the construction company estimates the quantities of materials, manpower, equipments & machineries required to complete
 the project. Then sundries, contingencies and profits are incorporated to arrive at an amount (or fee) needed to complete the project. This would be submitted/quoted
 to the government body along with other documents as required and specified in the tender document. If the construction company happen to comply with all the requirements and their quoted amount is least among other tenderers, they would be awarded the job by the government body.

The procurement team purchases the materials required for the projects and sends them to site as and when required. Then the site team initiates the work at site and
 starts the process of execution. The site team comprising of different professionals (Civil, architecture, mechanical, electrical etc.) plans the work, manages 
4M (Manpower, Material, Machinery and Money) and executes the work according to the drawings prepared normally by a design consultant. As and when the work is 
reaching a milestone, billing engineer invoices to the client in accordance with pre-agreed terms and conditions. If the client is satisfied that the claim is valid,
 they would be paid. This continues until all work is complete.

After the work is complete, handover process commences and the construction company has to be handover a fully operational building and infrastructure works without
 any pending works.

Then the construction company would repeat the above process again for different projects. In a nut shell, construction companies constructs the works and make 
revenue from their clients.
